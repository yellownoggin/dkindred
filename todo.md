## DONE
- <!-- - toolbar consistent: make toolbar component consistent with simple dynamic -->

## inbox

-  brancho:
    * delete other branches
        *   (create workshop branch: idea is to use commits/squash commits as the documentation)

        * o'reilly git pocket guide
            * http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000561/ch05.html#branch-deletion

    * general strategy 4 developing with github/jet(git workflow)
* digital kindred notes
    * development notes: ngsanitize wouldn'toinjected into the component module had to be in the outer component site module(in this case core module/may try layout module)
